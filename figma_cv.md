Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Engineering Manager position supporting the Security team at Figma. 
From the job description, it sounds very similar to the work that I've done at Datto.
I am a high-energy, enthusiastic leader who is passionate about security and privacy. I have a proven track record of
leading engineers whose work has a strong security component: Networking equipment, user authentication, and web-based technology.

I have the technical chops for this job, and I am very comfortable leading teams from 2 to 15 engineers. My leadership style is based on humility, candor and building consensus. I believe in a growth mindset, and Figma's value of "Grow as you go" resonates strongly with me.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to Figma's mission and be a part of its engaged and creative engineering community.

Sincerely,
Bill Moon
