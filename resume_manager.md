### 2004 - 2012: Eastman Kodak Company
#### Lead Software Developer - "HIPPO" team
* HIPPO is the image processing DLL used by twain, WIA and ISIS drivers for Kodak document scanners.  It is a
  multithreaded, multiplatform (Windows, Linux, Mac) library, over 300 KLOC and is deployed on millions of PCs all over
  the world. HIPPO is designed to be very fast - it’s optimized using assembly-code and the Intel IPP library.
* Led a team of 2-5 other developers. Consistently delivered on-time without major bugs.
* Worked closely with Advanced Development team to commercialize and optimize dozens of IP algorithms including
  metamerism detection, user preferences, blank page detection, autocrop/deskew, color drop out, photo segmentation,
  background color smoothing, binarization, automatic image orientation, image edge fill, streak removal.
* Adapted a photo segmentation algorithm for with AiOs printers. Algorithm needed numerous changes to find photos on a
  flatbed. Algorithm works reliably on dozens of different scanners, and is deployed to millions of customers.
* Created automated timing benchmarks to ensure that code changes are not only correct, but don’t get slower.
* Wrote highly optimized code using SSE assembly and OpenMP for multi-threaded color space conversion.
* Overhauled memory management to efficiently use memory-mapped files as buffers. Tuned buffer reuse heuristics to
  maximize speed and minimize memory usage.
* Designed and helped write a Python-based distributed build system, using dedicated build machines and a simple
  web-based interface. Build system was adopted by many other teams in DI. Builds are done on native OS’s.
* Helped design a genetic algorithm to tune the parameters of a complex binarization algorithm.
* Added interfaces to HIPPO to dynamically provide additional functionality via other libraries (some in-house, some
  off-the-shelf) while providing a consistent interface to HIPPO itself.
* Designed a split image chain for the i4000 scanner system, where the embedded system does some IP and HIPPO does the
  rest. Since the rules for governing the division of labor are complicated, I developed a semi-automatic testing
  apparatus that validated the “rules” logic.
