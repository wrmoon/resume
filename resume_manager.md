  multithreaded, multiplatform (Windows, Linux, Mac) library, over 300 KLOC and is deployed on millions of PCs all over
  the world. HIPPO is designed to be very fast - it’s optimized using assembly-code and the Intel IPP library.
* Led a team of 2-5 other developers. Consistently delivered on-time without major bugs.
* Worked closely with Advanced Development team to commercialize and optimize dozens of IP algorithms including
  metamerism detection, user preferences, blank page detection, autocrop/deskew, color drop out, photo segmentation,
  background color smoothing, binarization, automatic image orientation, image edge fill, streak removal.
* Adapted a photo segmentation algorithm for with AiOs printers. Algorithm needed numerous changes to find photos on a
