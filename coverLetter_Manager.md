# Cover Letter

I've been an engineer for my entire career, which stretches back almost 30 years. For most of that time, I've led teams of other engineers. Sometimes the teams consisted of myself and one other engineer. On the other end of the spectrum, I was principal engineer guiding 3 scrum teams for DNA. I've been leading teams of people for so long, I like to think the challenge and rewards of cultivating team morale and productivity come naturally to me. 

I know that I won't be coming into this role with any formal training or credentials in people management. Nevertheless, I _know_ I can hit this ground running. I can coach engineers at any stage of their career, I can motivate teams to improve their productivty, job satisfaction, and morale. I have the technical chops to be able to "talk shop" with anyone who reports to me, which helps build a rapport. Plus I can work with the leads to make good architectural decisions, and establish direction. 

Please reach out to anyone who's ever worked with me  - whether in engineering, QA, support, recruiting, people or product management. I'm confident that they will all vouch for my technical skils, interpersonal abilities, enthusiasm, communication skills, and sincerity.

I also know that this change will be dramatic for me, but in another sense, this role will be familiar as I've been doing it for so long.


Sincerely yours,

Bill Moon
