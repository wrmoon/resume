# Cover Letter

I've been leading engineering teams for almost 20 years, mostly in the role of "lead engineer". In 2020, I realized 
that I was getting as much (or more) enjoyment out of the leadership part of the role as the technical part. Luckily,
our team was growing, and there was an opportunity for me to pivot into management. 

As a manager, many aspects of the job were very familiar to me - helping other engineers work through their designs,
promoting improvements to how things get done, and removing roadblocks and distractions so the rest of the team can stay
focused. I relished the new aspects of the job, too: I worked more closely with the product owners to refine and
collaborate on new work, and negotiated a healthy balance of working on technical debt vs new features.  At that time,
Datto had no scrum masters, so I performed large parts of that role as well. Naturally, a large part of being a manager 
involved coaching the team not only in technical matters, but also to gently nudge them to be better team members as
well. In the early days of covid, I learned how to be a better listener and we all worked through our feelings of
isolation and anxiety. 

On my resume I list out five leadership skills: effective communication, accountability, proactivity, being open minded,
and passion.  These skills are not just words to me, but something I take seriously and I'm always working to improve
them. I lead my teams by earning their trust and respect, as it is the foundation for everything else.






Sincerely yours,

Bill Moon
