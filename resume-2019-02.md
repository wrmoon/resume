 uses mostly PHP, with a mySQL datastore.
* Technical lead for 14 developers on three scrum teams. Besides writing code, I defined coding standards, refined team policies and workflows, reviewed other developers' designs and code.
* Designed (or helped design) numerous subsystems including communication between router and Datto's servers,
device services, and overall product architecture.
* Led initiatives to improve schema of device configuration, improve unit test coverage, and code layout.
* Diagnosed field issues using variety of network tools including arp, netstat, traceroute, tcpdump.

* Led four other developers to deliver a major update to the Scan Station product line.
* Underwent intensive training for network security - SANS 401 (70 hours), plus week-long Microsoft-led developer training.
* Identified and corrected security vulnerabilities due to bad crypto techniques, network and IIS settings.
* Completely overhauled build system - transformed an error-prone manual process that took 4 days to an automated one
  that takes 10 minutes.
* Redesigned "Scan Station Admin Tool" (C#, WPF/XAML) to improve usability and maintainability.
* Simplified scanner startup app, eliminating > 1000 lines of redundant code.
* Our team fixed hundreds of bugs, implemented dozens of features, and refactored thousands of lines of legacy code.

### 2012 - 2013: Eastman Kodak Company 
#### Lead Software Developer - Asset Management Project
* Kodak's Asset Management System is a client/server application suite using C#, WCF, SQL, XAML, and Silverlight
  technologies.
* Came up to speed quickly to fix bugs and add functionality to multiple subsystems. Became team lead of four other
  developers soon thereafter.
* Redesigned UI for client application for improved usability and maintainability.
* Refactored web applications to promote testability and reduce LOC.
* Added suite of unit tests for web service using nunit.
* Created wrapper code for Chilkat SMTP and mail services.

<div>
### 2004 - 2012: Eastman Kodak Company 
#### Lead Software Developer - "HIPPO" team
* HIPPO is the image processing DLL used by twain, WIA, and ISIS drivers for Kodak document scanners.  It is a
  multithreaded, multiplatform (Windows, Linux, Mac) library, over 300 KLOC, and is deployed on millions of PCs all over
  the world. HIPPO is designed to be very fast - it’s optimized using assembly-code, and the Intel IPP library.
* Led a team of 2-5 other developers. Consistently delivered on-time without major bugs. 
* Overhauled regression tests - Transformed a manual process pieced together with batch files to a fully automated
  Python-based suite of over 300 tests, and processing over 13GB of image data.
* Worked closely with Advanced Development team to commercialize and optimize dozens of IP algorithms including
  metamerism detection, user preferences, blank page detection, autocrop/deskew, color drop out, photo segmentation,
  background color smoothing, binarization, automatic image orientation, image edge fill, streak removal.
* Adapted a photo segmentation algorithm for with AiOs printers. Algorithm needed numerous changes to find photos on a
  flatbed. Algorithm works reliably on dozens of different scanners, and is deployed to millions of customers.
* Created automated timing benchmarks to ensure that code changes are not only correct, but don’t get slower.
* Wrote highly optimized code using SSE assembly and OpenMP for multi-threaded color space conversion.
* Overhauled memory management to efficiently use memory-mapped files as buffers. Tuned buffer reuse heuristics to
  maximize speed and minimize memory usage.
* Designed and helped write a Python-based distributed build system, using dedicated build machines, and a simple
  web-based interface. Build system was adopted by many other teams in DI. Builds are done on native OS’s.
* Primary Perforce server administrator for ~70 users. Investigated performance issues, maintained backup scripts.
* Improved business processes by which code and information was shared between the HIPPO team and advanced development,
  which vastly improved time-to-market.
* Helped to design new architecture for scanner driver to improve subsystem modularity. Interfaces were XML-based, which
  greatly improved ability to upgrade components without worrying about forward/backward compatibility.
* Deployed and administered a wiki for DI.
* Helped design a genetic algorithm to tune the parameters of a complex binarization algorithm.
* Added interfaces to HIPPO to dynamically provide additional functionality via other libraries (some in-house, some
  off-the-shelf) while providing a consistent interface to HIPPO itself.
* Designed a split image chain for the i4000 scanner system, where the embedded system does some IP, and HIPPO does the
  rest. Since the rules for governing the division of labor are complicated, I developed a semi-automatic testing
  apparatus that validated the “rules” logic.

### 1999 - 2004: Eastman Kodak Company 
#### Software Developer - Digital Minilab Systems
* Wrote image-processing library from scratch to do rotation, mirroring, matrix operations, and 3D lookup tables for
  Noritsu S1200 film scanner. Code was optimized for Pentium 4 processors by writing parts in MMX assembly language.
* Wrote an Arcnet packet analyzer to reverse-engineer Noritsu film gates.
* Created and maintained a web-based scanner documentation system to record large amounts of changing specifications,
  and email exchanged between Kodak and Noritsu.
* Responsible for design and implementation of numerous systems in scanner interface software, including HTML-based
  logging, low-level device driver interface objects, a resource manager, and support for film gates that use mounted
  film.
* Was group expert with Rational ClearCase, Parasoft CodeWizard, and Doxygen.
* Diagnosed and corrected problems with multi-threaded code.
* Scanner interface for 1640/1650/8-base scanners:
    * Wrote low-level scanner interface in C++. Interface was responsible for basic image processing.
    * Wrote image rotation code in MMX assembly language.

* Overhauled buggy legacy firmware:
    * Implemented a transaction-based firmware upgrade and parameter storage system.
    * Assisted in the investigation and diagnosis of scanner manufacturing issues.
    * Refined manufacturing test procedures, and created testing and diagnostic capabilities to scanners.
* Mentored another firmware engineer.
* Scanner interface work for Noritsu S2 scanner.
