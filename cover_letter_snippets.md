Figma's design platform is the best I've seen. Your product's reputation  - and the reputation of your company - show that you have a culture of quality and a history of taking care of your people. 

I am a manager with a track record of guiding engineers through change, keeping them focused on their goals, and creating an environment that helps them grow. I am very experienced working remotely with a diverse team, and being the torchbearer for a culture of trust, accountability, and fun. 

I think I'd be a great fit for Figma, and I'd love to talk more about that!

While working at Datto, I had to demonstrate our new cloud-based router product in front of an audience of 800 people. I
had to cut the demo short after the router stopped responding after a live configuration change! We ultimately had to reboot the entire project  with a new backend architecture and embedded operating system. The architecture we originally used (based on RabbitMQ) was, at the time, too foreign for our IT department to provision, instrument, and maintain. I learned to be very cautious about new tech stacks - to make sure there is sufficient expertise in development, devops, IT, security, etc. before jumping in with both feet.

I am an experienced (25+ years) developer, with a broad set of skills and experience. I'm also a proven team player with strong leadership skills. I don't have a lot of AWS experience, but I'm currently studying to get my AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification. I'd love to talk more about this position, and how I might exceed your expectations!

After reading about CZI's mission and approach, I got a thrill of excitement at the prospect of working there! I would absolutely love to work for an organization that is making a real difference in the world.

I came from a rural farming town in central NY and moved to the "big" city of Rochester to go to school. This helped to broaden my world view by exposing me to people with different skin colors, countries, and physical abilities. I think that exposure helped to broaden my sense of compassion and reverence for the diversity of human experience.

I fell in love with Rochester, and have been living in the area now for most of my life. I volunteer weekly at a local food shelf, and I do handyman services for other charities as well. I am a lifelong devotee to science (I have been reading Scientific American cover to cover every month for 30+ years).

I have spent most of my career as a software developer - and the last 15 in a technical leadership role or as manager. As an engineer, I am quality focused, and a jack-of-all-trades. As a manager, I have a superpower of knowing how to motivate teams with a mixture of loving kindness and candor.

I may not have all of the experience you're looking for with this position, but believe me I'm a fast learner.

I have been a software engineer for most of my career, with 10+ years in technical leadership. In 2020, decided to move into management after I realized that my skills and interests involved the people on the team as much as the tech.
In the course of my career, I've earned the confidence and respect of those I've worked with and I have a good track record of successful project outcomes.

I look forward to talking with you more about this position!

When I started working at Datto in 2015 it was still a startup company. I love the fact that at a startup, you get to wear many hats and there is little or no red tape to get in the way of getting things done. I love the fast pace, and making important decisions. Datto was always a company that had lots of offices, and it wasn't uncommon to have teammates all over the country. During the COVID years, we made the transition to all-remote pretty quickly and relatively painlessly. As manager, about 1/2 of my direct reports were in a different timezone. We always had our cameras on, and it was part of our culture to hop on a short video call if someone had a question. That helped to preserve as best as we could the benefits of working together in an office.

I am an experienced (25+ years) developer, with a broad set of skills and experience. I'm also a proven team player with strong leadership skills.  I may not have much experience in building massive distributed systems, but I am well versed in all aspects of modern software architecture patterns, finding bottlenecks, fixing race conditions, and solving difficult problems. I have experience with a variety of observability tools such as Splunk, Kibana, DataDog, and NewRelic.

I am humble, smart, enthusiastic, and extremely curious - and I'd love to talk more about this position with you!
