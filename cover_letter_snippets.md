Figma's design platform is the best I've seen. Your product's reputation  - and the reputation of your company - show that you have a culture of quality and a history of taking care of your people. 

I am a manager with a track record of guiding engineers through change, keeping them focused on their goals, and creating an environment that helps them grow. I am very experienced working remotely with a diverse team, and being the torchbearer for a culture of trust, accountability, and fun. 

I think I'd be a great fit for Figma, and I'd love to talk more about that!

While working at Datto, I had to demonstrate our new cloud-based router product in front of an audience of 800 people. I
had to cut the demo short after the router stopped responding after a live configuration change! We ultimately had to reboot the entire project  with a new backend architecture and embedded operating system. The architecture we originally used (based on RabbitMQ) was, at the time, too foreign for our IT department to provision, instrument, and maintain. I learned to be very cautious about new tech stacks - to make sure there is sufficient expertise in development, devops, IT, security, etc. before jumping in with both feet.

I am an experienced (25+ years) developer, with a broad set of skills and experience. I'm also a proven team player with strong leadership skills. I don't have a lot of AWS experience, but I'm currently studying to get my AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification. I'd love to talk more about this position, and how I might exceed your expectations!

After reading about CZI's mission and approach, I got a thrill of excitement at the prospect of working there! I would absolutely love to work for an organization that is making a real difference in the world.

I came from a rural farming town in central NY and moved to the "big" city of Rochester to go to school. This helped to broaden my world view by exposing me to people with different skin colors, countries, and physical abilities. I think that exposure helped to broaden my sense of compassion and reverence for the diversity of human experience.

I fell in love with Rochester, and have been living in the area now for most of my life. I volunteer weekly at a local food shelf, and I do handyman services for other charities as well. I am a lifelong devotee to science (I have been reading Scientific American cover to cover every month for 30+ years).
