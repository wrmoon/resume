# Cover Letter

I've been working at Datto for over four years now... most of that time I've been the principal engineer and team lead for DNA. In that time, I've earned the confidence and respect of those I've worked with - in engineering, QA, support and product management.

When I heard that there was a job opening for the Product Manager for the WiFi products, I was excited - not only because I know that this role is sorely needed in DNET, but because this gives me the opportunity to continue to make a meaningful contribution to DNET.

I know that I won't be coming into this role with any formal training or credentials in business management. But throughout my career, I've always been aware and sensitive to the business needs of whatever product I've worked on. I also have very good interpersonal skills, which help to cement and strengthen any team that I work on. Having been an engineer for the past 27 years gives me a keen appreciation of what engineers do, how they do it, what their needs are, and what motivates them.

Since access points are a highly technological product, any product manager for this job needs to have a strong technical background. I got that covered. I'll make sure that I come up to speed quickly with any gaps in my knowledge with respect to WiFi technology.

I also know that this change will be dramatic for me. I'll now need to concentrate on _what_ needs to get done, and leave the _how_ to the engineers. It'll take a little getting used to, but I'm up to the challenge.

I'd love to be able to interview for this position, learn more about what the job entails, and see if it's a good fit for Datto and me.


Sincerely yours,

Bill Moon
