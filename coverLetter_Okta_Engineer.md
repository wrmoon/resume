Dear Hiring Manager, 

I became acquainted with Okta in 2019 when I started working on Datto's "Authweb" service, which handles SSO, user authentication and authorization for Datto's partner portal. During my time on Authweb, I led my team to evaluate whether to purchase Okta's services or continue with our in-house user management system. This experience allowed me to collaborate with Okta professionals, which left me with a good impression. I was also impressed by the company's reputation as a workplace. I recently spoke with my former colleague, Heidi Clayton, who had nothing but good things to say about Okta. 

With close to 30 years of software development experience, including over a decade focused on web technologies, HTML,REST APIs, and more, I'm well-equipped to support Okta's mission in identity management. I've spent three years working directly with authentication and authorization protocols like OAuth, OpenID Connect, and SAML. Over the years, I've had the opportunity to work with a wide range of programming languages, platforms, data storage systems, and technologies, which demonstrates my ability to adapt quickly and my eagerness to keep learning new things.

In the course of my career, I've earned the confidence and respect of those I've worked with, and I have a good track record of successful project outcomes. In recent years I have been in management, but I look forward to getting back to my roots, and refreshing my technical chops as an individual contributor. 

I'm genuinely excited about the possibility of joining the Okta team and contributing to the company's growth. I look forward to discussing how Okta can benefit from experience and skills.

Thank you for considering my application, and I'm eager to explore the potential next steps at Okta.

Sincerely,

Bill Moon
